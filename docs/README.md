#### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

To verify horizontal scaling is configured against CPU usage:

```bash
kubectl get hpa
```

## Continuous Integration & Deployment Pipeline

#### Docker Locally

Verifying that Docker images running containers on the local machine before pushing them to DockerHub.

```bash
docker images
docker ps
```

## Infrastructure Review

To help review the infrastructure setup, the above screenshots demonstrate:

1. **Kubernetes Cluster Health**: All pods are running successfully
2. **Service Discovery**: Kubernetes services are properly configured
3. **Auto-scaling**: HPA is configured for CPU-based scaling
4. **Monitoring & Logging**: Application logs are accessible via kubectl
5. **Container Registry**: Docker images are successfully pushed to DockerHub
6. **CI/CD Pipeline**: CircleCI is integrated with GitHub and executing successful deployments

This confirms that the microservices architecture is properly deployed and the continuous integration pipeline is functioning as expected.
